These are Alejandro García Salas' ([that's me](http://alejandrogarciasalas.me)) opinions, raw thoughts, and random rambling in a web-log (a [blog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog)!).

### Who is Alejandro?
"I am a T-shaped fullstack hacker with a passion for design, education and creative entrepreneurship."

<!-- Even though dissecting someone's identity into bullet points can be a short-sighted task, it can be useful for painting a general image of someone's character. Personally I like to describe myself as a:
<blockquote>
"T-shaped fullstack hacker with a passion for design, education and creative entrepreneurship."
</blockquote>

####What do I mean by this?

* #####t-shaped
The vertical bar on the T represents the depth of related skills and expertise in a single field, whereas the horizontal bar is the ability to collaborate across disciplines with experts in other areas and to apply knowledge in areas of expertise other than one's own." ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills))

	This is me at the moment:



* #####full-stack
	What does *full-stack* mean? What are these "*stacks*"? And how can you even cover *all* of them? For me it means versatility, I've developed [mobile apps](https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/algarcia/id507322805), [taught front-end](http://laboratoria.la/) and worked doing back-end web development.
	
	*[This is an article](http://andyshora.com/full-stack-developers.html) I like about the subject, written by Andy Shora.*

* #####hacker
  When you search for the word *hacker* on Google images, this is what you get:
  ![hacker-google-images](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30763013/blog/images/hackers-google-images.png)
This is **not** a hacker. 

*Let's try again.*
 
   This is what you get when you search for *hacker* in Wikipedia:

![hackers-wikipedia](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/30763013/blog/images/hackers-wikipedia.png)

Aha! Notice the distintion between hacker ([computer security]()) , someone who breaks into a computer system (also known as a cracker), and a hacker ([hacker culture]()), someone who follows the hacker ethos, enjoys creative exploration, sharing and looking for smart new ways for solving a problem. Note that being a  hacker  **is not exclusive to technology, [everyone can be a hacker]()**.

* #####with a passion for:
  * #####design
  <blockquote>
	"Everything is designed. Everything!"
	– Paul Rand
  </blockquote>
I first got into graphic design while developing [my first iOS game](),  4 years ago. I was forced to learn to use more  sophisticated tools (i.e Illustrator) after realizing MS Paint was quite ineffective. 

A year after that I got more interested  on design as a discipline,  after watching Gary's Hustwit's <ins>amazing</ins> *Design Trilogy*: [*Objectified*](), [*Helvetica*]() and [*Urbanized*](). Every object, every typeface and every space has been designed.

Up to the date I've worked doing UI/UX here, made some graphics here and there, but what I've feel I've got the most of learning about design, is realizing that everything is designed, and how everything becomes more interesting that way, mesmerazing at design that usually goes unnoticed is like discovering a whole new world!

  "Good design is invisible"
    – Dieter Rams
  </blockquote>

  * #####education
  Education is a ripple effect, that is educate one member of the community and that person can lift its community out of poverty, generate jobs and even educate other members of its community.
  
  Being from Peru, I care about education.
  
  I believe the current education system is broken. I've str
  
  Probably one of the most fulfilling endeavours I've been part of, up to the 	date, related to education  is [Laboratoria](http://laboratoria.la/), a tech social enterprise that empowers young women from low-income backgrounds by giving them access to education (in the means of the bootcamp) and work in the digital sector. 
  
 **Education is something that bugs me, I want to change that.**
  
   *I am working on a project related to education right now, [hit me]() up if you are interested.*

  * #####creative entrepreneurship
  	When people think about entrepreneurship many images come into mind, business people creating startups, the college dropout giving a [10 deck pitch]() ([or maybe 6?]()). Moreover "*buzzwords*" such as *lean startup*, *return of investment*, *user validation*  become common speech. 
  	  	Even though I find all of these really interesting, I rather follow entrepreneurship from its core values, going from idea to starting something, [getting out of the building](http://www.inc.com/steve-blank/key-to-success-getting-out-of-building.html), getting out of your comfort zone, asking questions withouting worrying about *what they might say*. That's what I truly mean when I decide to describe myself as passionate about *entrepreneurship*.
  	
  	What about *creative* entrepreneurship? Creativity is something that everybody has, is something that everyone can experience and harness if they believe they can. Creativity allows us to find new ways of doing things. Why do what everyone else is doing?

  In a snitch **That's  *who* I am**.
