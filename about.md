These are Alejandro García Salas' ([that's me](http://alejandro.pe)) opinions, raw thoughts, and random rambling in a weblog. I created this weblog mostly for myself. I use this weblog to keep track of my thoughts and ideas, as a tool for thinking (by writing), and to practice my writing skills.

## FAQ

### Who is Alejandro?
[That's me!](http://alejandrogarciasalas.me)

### What is a "weblog"?
I am glad you asked! Fun fact, the word "blog" is a truncation of the world "weblog" i.e. a log on the web!

### Why is this written in English and not Spanish?
If you know me in person you might know I was born and raised in Lima-Perú, thus my native language is Spanish. I decided to (mostly) blog in English because this is the language I wanted to practice writing on the most. Spanish is a beautiful and complex language, but, because I’ve been recently reading a lot of books in English, I suspect I am currently a better English writer. Also, as of now (2017) English is still (sadly), the most popular language on the Internet which means my writing could presumably, reach a bigger audience.
