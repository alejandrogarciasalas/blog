These are Alejandro Garc√≠a Salas' ([that's me](http://alejandrogarciasalas.me)) opinions, raw thoughts, and random rambling in a web-log (a [blog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog)!).

### Who is Alejandro?
I am a t-shaped hacker with a passion for design. I am interested in augmented cognition, ed-tech, human computer interaction and entrepreneurship.

I've been programming since I was 13 and I love it. In my spare time, I like hacking on open source projects, learning as much as I can and reading about new ways technology can empower human potential.

I am currently studying Computer Science and Cognitive Science at UC Berkeley.
