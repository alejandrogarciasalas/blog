-"Hello?" My hands were all sweaty.
-"Mr. Wozniak I am one of your biggest fans! I have recently developed some iOS apps; could we possibly meet?"
-It worked!
The co-founder of Apple, the man who gave us the personal-computer revolution, agreed to meet me! "You made the art too? I've always been good at math, but never with the artistic side of making a videogame." he answered after showing him "Warrior Duck". His words shocked me.
What I've learned through the years about programming not only allowed me to publish 3 apps, but to maintain an enthralling conversation with someone who shared my genuine passion for technology. Automatically, I began to share my craziest ideas about wearable computing and online education. Despite the age difference, we spoke the same language and our conversation ran for more than an hour. But the main thing I took away from Woz was the importance of humility. He told me how he never aspired to be a rich man, but how his only true desire was to create something he wanted, while having fun.
 
"I want to keep hearing from you," he told me.Woz, you definitely will!
