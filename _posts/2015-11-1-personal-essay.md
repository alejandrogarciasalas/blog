At the age of 5 I realized that what most people called "intelligence" was nothing more than curiosity unleashed. That is why the two best skills I've ever acquired are learning how to turn on a computer and "how to Google".

I was in kindergarten when I got my first computer. Though initially I had to share it with my older sister, after a few days it practically became mine. As I engrossed myself in exploring the educational games my dad had installed on it, staring at a flashy screen became my childhood hobby.

I was a curious child.

"You drove me crazy" my mother now reminds me, "you asked so many questions that I just couldn't answer them all." Luckily, dial-up Internet arrived in Peru in the early 2000's and my dad had the brightest idea of all: "Why don't you look up all of those questions online?"

Click click click.

-"Why is the ocean salty?"

Click click click.

-"How did the Egyptians build their pyramids?"

Click click click.

-"Why does the week have 7 days?"

Click click click.

-"How does a car motor work?" Click click click.

I simply fell in love with that sound. Unlike before there was no limit to the amount of knowledge I could extract from one place. The Internet gave me confidence to share what I have learned with everybody regardless of his or her interest level. It not only fueled my passion for learning, but the Internet also led me to many new sources of entertainment.

"You are becoming an addict," my mother yelled at me.

"I am fine just let me finish this level and I'll go eat!"

- "Just pause the game"

"You can't pause an online game!" I told her irritably while I navigated the virtual world of Kalimdor.

Though I can proudly say that a great deal of the English I know now is thanks to video games, I cannot say the same for how much time I spent as a child playing them.

My motor of intellectual development transformed when I got my first iPod on my 13th birthday. In that year I not only discovered the Apple App Store, but the concept of an independent app developer too. I became obsessed with a game called "Jelly Car" and that obsession led me to Google the most important questions of all:

Click click click.

-"How do I make an app?"

Click click click.

-"How do I learn to code?"

Click click click.

-"How do I make computer graphics?"

My teenage curiosity had transformed into an adult desire to learn. I have always tried to do something that I was not a hundred percent ready to do. What had started with simple video tutorials about programming quickly moved into ordering U.S books and later into taking university online courses. Thanks to Google I became a virtual autodidact.

A keyboard and a mouse pad became my teenage tabula rasa, where I could type my craziest ideas freely. I was 14 when I published my first app. However "Warrior Duck" did not hit the market until I turned 15. From the storyline, inspired by the Moche pre-Inca culture, to the code that made it work and finally the computer graphics made out of my stick figure sketches, I began living the dream that my heroes once had when my app went on sale.

The Internet fueled my curiosity and helped me go from being a young gamer to a teenage game developer in less than ten years. Although I still play video games I prefer to produce and design my own. By building apps I am still a kid at play and although my mom is still yelling at me, she is now more understanding. Her son is no longer wasting time, but building a digital empire instead.
